# Project
This is part of the NYU Tandon Career Hub - LeetCode BootCamp (Fall 2022). 

Here's a starter kit to get you started for the Open Weather API project. 

You have two options to get started with the project: 
### 1. JS Starter Kit: 
It includes a HTML/CSS/JS setup to get started. It can used as a beginner friendly project or can be turned into an advanced project with the help of JS libraries such as [React.js](https://reactjs.org) or [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) to build user interfaces.  

### 2. Flask Starter Kit: 
It includes a basic HTML/CSS/Python setup to get started. The folder includes further instructions to setup the project and get started.
