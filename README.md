# Project
This is part of the NYU Tandon Career Hub - LeetCode BootCamp (Fall 2022). 

Here's a starter kit to get you started for the Open Weather API project. You have two options to get started with the project: 
1. JS Starter Kit: It includes a basic HTML/CSS/JS setup to get started. It can used as a beginner friendly project or can be turned into an advanced project with the help of JS libraries such as React.js or Next.js 
2. Flask Starter Kit: It includes a basic HTML/CSS/Python setup to get started.
